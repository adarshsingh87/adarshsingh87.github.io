      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>If I'm not coding</strong>, I'm probably gaming or watching something related to coding on youtube (probably theo, primeagen or fireship).
